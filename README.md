# Install WordPress through Composer and WP-CLI

Quickly launch a WordPress instance through Composer and WP-CLI

## Install

Via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) and [WP-CLI](https://wp-cli.org/):

1. Create the [WordPress database and user](https://wordpress.org/support/article/how-to-install-wordpress/#step-2-create-the-database-and-a-user)
2. Set environment variables: Copy the code below to an editor, replace all values (such as `{YOUR_SITE_FOLDER_NAME}`) with your own values, and then paste it on the terminal to execute:

```bash
export FOLDER_NAME={YOUR_SITE_FOLDER_NAME} #eg: MyAwesomeSite
export DB_NAME={YOUR_SITE_DB_NAME} #eg: database
export DB_USER={YOUR_SITE_DB_USER} #eg: admin
export DB_PASSWORD={YOUR_SITE_DB_PASSWORD} #eg: sADF!kl9diq@#Sjfk
export DB_HOST={YOUR_SITE_DB_HOST} #eg: 127.0.0.1

export ADMIN_USER={ADMIN_USER} #eg: admin
export ADMIN_PASSWORD={ADMIN_PASSWORD} #eg: JKo$@sfjASD00w
export ADMIN_EMAIL={ADMIN_EMAIL} #eg: pedro@example.com
```

3. In the terminal, `cd` to the folder where to install the site, and execute script:

```bash
